When rolling the dice on the mobile app, the
user taps a button to roll 3D dice across the
screen. After rolling the camera moves to a
birds eye view and the dice are automatically
lined up in an easy to read way. The user can
then select the dice they want to reroll if
any and confirm their choice at the bottom of
the screen.
