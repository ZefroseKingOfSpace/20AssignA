Yahtzee Rules

Yahtzee is a dice game thats based on your score. Players roll a set of five dice and then assign the dice to a category based on what values they roll on the dice. 


// Todo: explain assigning score, including that fact that you can't repeat categories, and assigning zero to categories where conditions are not met

Yahtzee turn description: Players take turns rolling the dice, and trying to get certain types of rolls, each with an assigned point value.
Players are allowed a total of three rolls, with any subset of dice capable of being set aside at each roll.

Scoring:

Upper section:


Categories are ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, and sixes.  In each category, to number of points scored is equal to the 
total number of pips on those dice.  For example, if your rolled three 4s, that would score 12 in the fours category.
